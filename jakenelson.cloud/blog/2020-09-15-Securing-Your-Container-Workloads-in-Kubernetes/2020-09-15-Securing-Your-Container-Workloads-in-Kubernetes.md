There are many places that workloads should be secured: In CI, within the cluster (securityContext & security policies), outside the cluster (firewalls), etc.

This article will specifically cover securing workloads with some Docker best practices and Kubernetes securityContext. These two sides go hand-in-hand to restrict inappropriate activities within the container.

### What Happens if I Don‚Äôt Do This (insert scare tactic¬†here)

Awake now? good stuff!

Let‚Äôs create a simple Dockerfile and build an image:

If we run the above image, what user do you think we‚Äôll be using?
```bash
$ docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q .)  
**root  
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)**
```
If you guessed root, you guessed right.

#### What‚Äôs wrong with letting user‚Äôs run as¬†root?

I‚Äôm guessing if you‚Äôre reading this article, you already know the answer to that question but I‚Äôll leave a couple brief points here that you can research further if you‚Äôre interested.

Workloads can potentially:

*   Breakout of isolation and impact other workloads or services.
*   ‚ÄúMess‚Äù with the host or Kubernetes API (denial of service, data exfiltration/extrusion, etc).

We as engineers, along with the engineers of the services we consume, put in security practices to make it as difficult as possible for someone to breach our systems; hurting us and our customers.

**Restricting root within the Dockerfile is the first step in securing the workload**.

### Locking Down The Dockerfile

You saw above that when we don‚Äôt define a user in a Dockerfile we end up running as root. To avoid this, let‚Äôs start by defining a user in the Dockerfile.

Let‚Äôs go over the interesting parts quickly:

`groupadd --gid 15555 notroot`

*   Create a group with an ID of 15555 named ‚Äúnotroot‚Äù.

`useradd --uid 15555 --gid 15555 -ms /bin/false notroot`

*   Creates a user with a user id of 15555 and a group ID of 15555 (the group we created in the line before).
*   Set‚Äôs its default shell to nothing.
*   Names the user ‚Äúnotroot‚Äù.

`USER notroot`

*   Set our new user account as the default user for this Docker image.

The obvious question you‚Äôre probably asking at the moment is, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd you pull 15555 from?‚Äù

The ID is made up, by you, but it‚Äôs recommended that we keep the IDs above 10000 to [avoid clashing](https://kubesec.io/basics/containers-securitycontext-runasuser/) with processes running on the Kubernetes host.

### Locking Down The Deployment Manifest

We‚Äôve now set some good practices in the Dockerfile, if we were to run this Docker image right now, we‚Äôd be:

*   Running as a non-root user
*   Restricting what we can manipulate within the file-system to our home directory (but it could also be your app directory where we need privilege).

Now that we‚Äôve got our best-practices container, we‚Äôll need to deploy it into our Kubernetes cluster.

Let‚Äôs take a super simple deployment like this:

After we deploy the above and check the log output we can see that the restrictions we put into the Docker image are working:
```bash
\> kubectl logs usertest-66fb6d564f-hnkpg  
**notroot  
uid=15555(notroot) gid=15555(notroot) groups=15555(notroot)**
```
Great! Thanks for reading! üëç

If only it were that simple.

We need to set some securityContext in the deployment that will tell Kubernetes, ‚Äú**This is what we‚Äôre running as and this is what it is allowed to do**‚Äù.

The critical danger is that if someone were to run something inside of your non-root user of the container, it could still be escalated to root (regardless of what we‚Äôve implemented thus far) and then do some naughty things.

#### Introducing securityContext

securityContext has more say than the Dockerfile around how the container can behave once running in the cluster, it‚Äôs built into Kubernetes, and it‚Äôs an essential security practice. Please use it!

Before we go into exactly how to add securityContext, it‚Äôs important to understand that **securityContext can be defined in two places** within a deployment:

*   [At the pod level](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#podsecuritycontext-v1-core)
*   [At the container level](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#securitycontext-v1-core)

Most of the securityContext will end up in the container spec for a good reason: When a security setting is defined in both pod and container spec and is valid in both specs, container wins.

See this excerpt from the Kubernetes source code:

I‚Äôll summarise the above snippet:

1.  If a `runAsUser` was defined in the pod spec securityContext, save it.
2.  If a `runAsUser` was defined in container securityContext, overwrite the value we just saved in step 1.
3.  If we have a securityContext saved, return it.

The result? **container securityContext wins.**

There are some settings that should be applied at the pod level though; namely the `fsGroup` setting.

#### Adding securityContext

Let‚Äôs take our deployment manifest from before and add the essentials of a securityContext then we‚Äôll summarise what we‚Äôve done to finish up (The end is nigh, I promise).

Here‚Äôs our new deployment manifest:

Breaking down the new lines:

`fsGroup: 15555` We‚Äôre setting the UID of our fsGroup. This is a supplement group that facilitates mounting. I would normally just assign the same group that I built the docker image with, though it doesn‚Äôt have to be that.

`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` Prevents modification of the root file-system. This will prevent writes to `/root` **even if you‚Äôre running as root**. This is great because it means even if someone managed to perform a privilege escalation to root inside your running container, they wouldn‚Äôt easily be able to modify system components.

`runAsUser: 15555` The UID (user id) we created when building our docker image. This is the user we are choosing to run our container with.

You might be curious, what happens if you were to set our runAsUser to UID that didn‚Äôt exist, like 1555¬†?

kubectl logs usertest-85f55f4fcd-4fm6h  
whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1555

**It doesn‚Äôt exist**, and as such most likely won‚Äôt have the correct permissions to the directories you need to run your app.

The deployment securityContext really seems to get the final say (well, there‚Äôs security policies which we can touch on in another article).

`runAsGroup: 15555` The GID (group id) that the container will run with and matches what we defined in our Dockerfile.

`privileged: false` Don‚Äôt set this to true unless you have a **really** good reason; it grants the container access to the host. See [more on privileged](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privileged).

`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` A best-effort prevention of privilege escalation.

Now that you‚Äôve got all these good practices in place, how can you ensure they stay in place?

The answer to that is a combination of data validation in CI (Conftest) and server side policies.

I won‚Äôt cover them in this article but I will recommend that you [read my article on Conftest](https://medium.com/faun/conftest-in-ci-54503226c225?source=friends_link&sk=419d53ea9c325a9eb082772f7c2bc6c7). With tools like Conftest in CI you are able to restrict your repos so that people can‚Äôt just ignore your best practice without CI failures, potentially alerts, and approval from a designated code-owner. You put in place whatever systems work for you.

You made it! Thanks for sticking in there.
