# Team Learning Hours

## What is a team learning hour?

The team groups up for a scheduled hour of learning something together.

This could be:

- Reviewing something new
- Testing out a new design/pattern/approach

## The Process

1. Consider what you want to learn and if it could be learned as a group inside an hour. It can be one part of a thing, it doesn't have to be an entire complex topic.
1. Book one hour with as much of the team as possible with a clear agenda of what you will learn and why.
1. Save some time at the end for review/discussion as a group about the thing you just learned. You'll probably come up with different pros and cons as well as different use cases for the patterns and techniques you learn.

## Resources

I learnt about this from the Arrested Devops Podcast episode for November 2021 with Emily Bache who is a technical agile coach.
