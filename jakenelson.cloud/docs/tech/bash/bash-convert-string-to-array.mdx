# Convert a String to an Array in Bash
### and iterate over it

## Example Scenario

In a situation where we receive a string that contains an array with a consistent delimeter we might want to iterate over
that in order to perform some action.

Example array as a string input.
We're assuming it's in this state because it was easy for the CI/CD tooling to pass in the array in this structure.

### Example data structure
```bash
TARGETS="email1@email.com, email2@email.com, email3@email.com"
```

In this case we want to iterate over each of those email addresses and send the person a message.

### Ensure consistency
Firstly, we want the string in a consistent state, we don't know if the input will include spaces or not so best we remove them.

```bash
TARGETS=$(echo "${TARGETS}" | tr -d ' ') # remove white space from targets array (currently a string)
```

We could also use a regex check to ensure that the email is a valid email but that's a bit overkill in this situation.

### Convert the now clean string to an array of values

```bash
IFS=',' read -r -a LIST_OF_TARGETS <<< "${TARGETS}" # convert the string into an array (comma delimeter)
```

#### What's happening here?

- We're setting the value separator (delimeter) with the `IFS=','` portion.
- We're creating an array called LIST_OF_TARGETS
- We're reading through the TARGETS string splitting the values into elements of the array.

### Loop the array (to do something)

```bash
for CURRENT_TARGET in "${LIST_OF_TARGETS[@]}"
do  
    if sendMessage "Hello" "${CURRENT_TARGET}; then
        echo "Sent successfully"
    else
        echo "Message failed to send"
    fi
done
```
