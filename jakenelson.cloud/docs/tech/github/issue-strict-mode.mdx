# Github Strict Mode Issue With Terraform

## Issue

When applying repositories and their branch protection settings via Terraform you will see that strict mode is being enabled every pipeline execution.

## Cause

Github API can't seem to set strict mode when a required status check is not attached, the strict mode setting comes underneath the branch protection settings.

## Resolution

None at this time.

## Workaround

Attach a required status check to the branch protection settings, even if it's a very simple status check that can be returnd every time.

Some example cases of pipelines that would be good for solving this issue:

* A security pipeline to check for credentials being committed on feature branches.
* A repository hygeine pipeline to ensure feature branches meet conventions and previously merged branches are removed (ideally this is mangaged via repository settings though).
