# Syncing Users & Groups from AzureAD

## Requirements

If users of the organisation are managed via Azure AD or Okta, they can be onboarded using group syncs.
[Integrate users directly with Azure AD via sync groups](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs/resources/team_sync_group_mapping).

Azure AD auth requirements for sync:
	
* Global administrator
* Privileged Role administrator

## Creating the sync

To create a synced group from AzureAD use a Terraform configuration like so:

```terraform
data "github_organization_team_sync_groups" "this" {}

resource "github_team_sync_group_mapping" "example_group_mapping" {
  team_slug        = "example"

  dynamic "group" {
    for_each = [for g in data.github_organization_team_sync_groups.this.groups : g if g.group_name == "some_team_group"]
    content {
      group_id          = group.value.group_id
      group_name        = group.value.group_name
      group_description = group.value.group_description
    }
  }
}

```

## Consuming users and teams

Once Onboarded you can consume them via data resources.

Use the `github_team` data resource for reading singular teams and the `github_teams` data resource for reading multiple at once.

Use the `github_user` data resource for reading singular users and the `github_users` data resource for reading multiple at once.
